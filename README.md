## Modules Overview

### Steps
A fusion of comparison logic and step sequencing makes complexity from simple controls. It visually displays the current position within the window.

### Envelope Array
An envelope generation powerhouse, offering smooth controls over the shape and dynamics of your sound. With six related envelope stages featuring adjustable slant and curve parameters. Creates single-shot or cycling envelopes ranging from ms to minutes.

### Penta Sequencer
A 5-step sequencer that redefines rhythmic and melodic structuring, offering Circle and Star modes for unique sequencing. Directional control and adjustable slew for smooth transitions.

### Impulse Controller
Simulate the movement of waves through a network of nodes with the Impulse Controller module. This module offers a unique approach to modulation, with 24 outputs representing the ebb and flow of energy through a complex node connected network.

### Signals
Observe and compare six signal inputs. Range from ms to secs with selector switch. With trigger reset toggle for visualizing envelopes.

### Ranges
Split two signals into a range of 0-12 fractional mixes. Easily generate musical intervals, pan or attenuate voltages, or as a source.

### Hex Mod
Six phase related LFOs, with Sync and unique controls over the phasing.

### Collatz
Generate polyrhythmic trigger sequences synchronized to a clock. Uses the Collatz conjecture to generate interesting patterns of polyrhythms.

### Strings
Generates chord voicings of a guitar. Intuitive button interface makes generating chord progressions a breeze. Displays guitar chords. Allows per string bending, whammy bar bending, and capo.

### Magnets
Simulate magnetism in a spin-lattice. Interact with the lattice with CV inputs. Outputs 24 4-pole filtered LFO signals.

### Ouros
A stereo phase injection oscillator with a unique polar display. Generate unique timbres, animated waveforms, and stereo effects. Morph continuously in an enormous latent space of complex wave shapes.

### Pressed Duck
A stereo 6 channel side-chain ducking mixer with compression, saturation, and feedback distortion.
